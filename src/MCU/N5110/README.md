N5110 LCD Library
=================

Function:              Library for interfacing with Nokia 5110 LCD display (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10168) using 
                       the hardware SPI on the mbed.The display is powered from a GPIO pin meaning it can be controlled                              via software. The LED backlight is also software-controllable (via PWM pin). Can print characters                            and strings to the display using the included 5x7 font. The library also implements a screen buffer                          so that individual pixels on the display (84 x 48) can be set, cleared and read. The library can                              print primitive shapes (lines, circles, rectangles). Acknowledgements to Chris Yan's Nokia_5110                              Library.
