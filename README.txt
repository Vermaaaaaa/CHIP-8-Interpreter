- To get started with this Interpreter, run this directory within a command line prompt and type make.
- If you do not have the gcc compiler, either install on a UNIX based system or install MSYS64 for windows and install the MINGW64 package.
- Next navigate to the config txt file and enter the name of the rom you wish to use (Make sure this rom is in the same directory).
- To run the Interpreter type ./chip8 in the directory you have compiled in or double click
- This chip 8 interpreter is in active development, so if a version does not compile revert to an older version. 
- Happy Playing!
